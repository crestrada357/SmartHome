# SmartHome Automation Project

This repository contains my personal Home Assistant configuration files used to automate various aspects of my smart home setup. It includes custom YAML automations, scripts, and integrations tailored for a Wi-Fi-based ecosystem using mostly Tuya Smart devices.

## ðŸŒŸ Features
- Automatic night light routines
- Failover recovery and reboot triggers
- Workarounds for Spanish speaking users. Have you noticed how simply changing the language in HA seems to break automations?

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- Home Assistant (running on Intel i7 / 16GB RAM setup)
- YAML for automations and scripts
- Tuya Smart devices (sensors, switches)
- ChatGPT-assisted config validation

## ðŸ§  Lessons Learned
- Debugging inconsistent device connectivity with Tuya
- Creating fallback automations to add some 'resilience'
- YAML optimization for better readability and reuse

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
Most configurations were tested in a real home setup in Ecuador with unstable Internet conditions, requiring robust offline fallbacks.
