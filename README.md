# SmartHome
Smart home stuff, automations, especially Home Assistant related.

Introduction: My Smart Home setup, and how I made it work exactly the way I wanted with Home Assistant, even though I use other platforms to perform basic actions.

Technologies Used: Home Assistant, YAML, HACS, TuyaSmart/SmartLife, Ring, TP-Link Deco/Tapo, Fully Kiosk Browser.

Features: Vacuum robots custom configs, Wall panel Badges, custom day of the week, time, weather forecast, temp & humidity sensors. Spanish language fixes.

Setup Instructions: Install HAOS on a recycled old PC, add HACS and Studio Code Server (helps with the indentation in YAML).
