#In HA, a Tuya Smart vacuum robot (named Pixel) didn't want to show battery percentage unless I accessed the identity first (multiple steps), so I added this to access it directly from anywhere in HA.

- name: "Porcentaje bater√≠a Pixel"
        unique_id: porcentaje_bateria_pixel
        unit_of_measurement: "%"
        state: "{{ state_attr('vacuum.pixel', 'battery_level') | int }}"

        #Add a 'Needle' indicator card in a dashboard using this entity, and it will look great.
